Stata code comparing difference-in-differences estimation methods

The .do file contains code for simulating a longitudinal dataset for two-period difference-in-differences estimation.

I compare misspecified and correctly specified estimates.

I produce a table comparing estimates produced from the "reg," "areg," "xtreg," and "xtreg, fe" commands.
